    let logCode = () => {
      console.log("logCode was called back")
    }

    //the meaning is that logCode is a callback inside set time out function. call back function is a function that pass in as a parameter to the function and called after something else has accured. on our example, the function set time out gets the function logCode as a parameter, and then the timmer of 3 seconds is running. after the timer is finised, the call back function is accuted.

    setTimeout(logCode, 3000);


    //now we can write our call back function to be more readable. thats mean that the function will be writted inside the set time out function.

    setTimeout(() => {

      console.log("this is a smarter way to make a call back by writing the call back inside of the function itself.");

    }, 5000);


    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log("old way to write");
    }, 10000);
